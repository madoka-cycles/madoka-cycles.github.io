## Creating a Site Repository

When creating your site repository, you have two options depending on your needs:

### Option 1. Using the Starter (Recommended)

This approach simplifies upgrades, isolates unnecessary files, and is perfect for users who want to focus on writing with minimal configuration.

1. Sign in to GitHub and navigate to the [**starter**][starter].
2. Click the <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button and then select <kbd>Create a new repository</kbd>.
3. Name the new repository `<username>.github.io`, replacing `username` with your lowercase GitHub username.

### Option 2. Forking the Theme

This approach is convenient for modifying features or UI design, but presents challenges during upgrades. So don't try this unless you are familiar with Jekyll and plan to heavily modify this theme.

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. [Fork the theme repository](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/fork).
3. Name the new repository `<username>.github.io`, replacing `username` with your lowercase GitHub username.

## Setting up the Environment

Once your repository is created, it's time to set up your development environment. There are two primary methods:

### Using Dev Containers (Recommended for Windows)

Dev Containers offer an isolated environment using Docker, which prevents conflicts with your system and ensures all dependencies are managed within the container.

**Steps**:

1. Install Docker:
   - On Windows/macOS, install [Docker Desktop][docker-desktop].
   - On Linux, install [Docker Engine][docker-engine].
2. Install [VS Code][vscode] and the [Dev Containers extension][dev-containers].
3. Clone your repository:
   - For Docker Desktop: Start VS Code and [clone your repo in a container volume][dc-clone-in-vol].
   - For Docker Engine: Clone your repo locally, then [open it in a container][dc-open-in-container] via VS Code.
4. Wait for the Dev Containers setup to complete.

### Setting up Natively (Recommended for Unix-like OS)

For Unix-like systems, you can set up the environment natively for optimal performance, though you can also use Dev Containers as an alternative.
